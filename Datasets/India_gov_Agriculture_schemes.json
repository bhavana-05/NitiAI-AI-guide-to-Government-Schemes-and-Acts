    "scheme_name": "Chief Minister Floriculture Mission",
    "details": "Prevalence of suitable agro climate has led to natural occurrence of a large number of flowering species in Assam having aesthetic value and horticultural importance. Existence of an ornamental garden is a tradition and characteristic feature of every household in Assam. From time immemorial, the State has been endowed with a rich diversity of flowering annuals and perennials, bulbous ornamental, amazing creepers, ferns and foliage and awesome orchids. In orchid alone, Assam is credited with the natural occurrence of 191 splendid species having diversified forms and wide colour range. Contrary to the potential and scope of commercialization, the State floriculture even till today, is largely confined to household garden as a part of hobby horticulture. The number of commercial pockets can be counted on fingers. Although, the State floriculture sector has shown some amount of growth under the impact of government sponsored development projects like HMNEH, the net position of the State in the National Floriculture Map is yet to be visible. Today, Assam registers an area of 1800 ha under total floriculture which is less than 1% of the total area under floriculture in the country and 7.8% of the total area under floriculture in the neighboring West Bengal.﻿It is further observed that even the neighboring states like West Bengal has a pride position in terms of area and production of flower crops eventually finding its way to the markets in Assam. Today, the incoming flower basket from West Bengal has virtually captured the State's flower market primarily due to low internal production and lack of consistency in supply as per desired volumes. According to unofficial estimates, the annual inflow of flowers to the State's flower market hovers around Rs. 7-8 crores paving out outflow of State's revenue in substantial quantum.It is now well accepted that in order to sustain agriculture as a profitable venture, due attention must be paid to selection of high value crop options that fetch higher return on investment per unit area. It has been an established fact that as a potential component of horticultural sector, the floriculture based enterprises can provide significantly higher net return to farmers compared to other agricultural production options due to their higher market prices resulting from uniqueness, diversified uses and fascination on part of higher income group.﻿",

The Government of India provides interest subvention of 2% and Prompt Repayment Incentive of 3% to the farmers, thus making the credit available at a very subsidized rate of 4% per annum.The scheme was further extended for the investment credit requirement of farmers viz. allied and non-farm activities in the year 2004 and further revisited in 2012 by a working Group under the Chairmanship of Shri T. M. Bhasin, CMD, Indian Bank with a view to simplify the scheme and facilitate issue of Electronic Kisan Credit Cards. The scheme provides broad guidelines to banks for operationalizing the KCC scheme. Implementing banks will have the discretion to adopt the same to suit institution/location-specific requirements.﻿Objective / PurposeThe Kisan Credit Card scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window with the flexible and simplified procedures to the farmers for their cultivation and other needs as indicated below :To meet the short term credit requirements for the cultivation of crops;Post-harvest expenses;Produce marketing loan;Consumption requirements of farmer household;Working capital for maintenance of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture;Investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities﻿Type of CardA magnetic stripe card with PIN (Personal Identification Number) with an ISO IIN (International Standards Organization International Identification Number) to enable access to all banks ATMs and micro ATMsIn cases where the Banks would want to utilize the centralized biometric authentication infrastructure of the UIDAI (Aadhaar authentication), debit cards with magnetic stripe and PIN with ISO IIN with biometric authentication of UIDAI can be provided.Debit Cards with magnetic stripes and only biometric authentication can also be provided depending on the customer base of the bank. Till such time, UIDAI becomes widespread, if the banks want to get started without inter-operability using their existing centralized bio metric infrastructure, banks may do so.Banks may choose to issue EMV (Europay, MasterCard and VISA, a global standard for the interoperation of integrated circuit cards) and RUPAY compliant chip cards with magnetic stripe and pin with ISO IIN.Further, biometric authentication and smart cards may follow the common open standards prescribed by IDRBT and IBA.

It is assumed that the farmer adopts the same cropping pattern for the remaining four years also. In case the cropping pattern adopted by the farmer is changed in the subsequent year, the limit may be reworked.Term loans for investmentstowards land development, minor irrigation, purchase of farm equipment and allied agricultural activities. The banks may fix the quantum of credit for the term and working capital limit for agricultural and allied activities, etc., based on the unit cost of the asset/s proposed to be acquired by the farmer, the allied activities already being undertaken on the farm, the bank’s judgment on repayment capacity vis-a-vis total loan burden devolving on the farmer, including existing loan obligations.The long-term loan limitis based on the proposed investments during the five-year period and the bank’s perception of the repaying capacity of the farmerMaximum Permissible Limit: The short-term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long-term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and treated as the Kisan Credit Card Limit.Fixation of Sub-limits for other than Marginal Farmers:Short-termloans and term loans are governed by different interest rates. Besides, at present, short-term crop loans are covered under Interest Subvention Scheme/ Prompt Repayment Incentive scheme. Further, repayment schedules and norms are different for short-term and term loans. Hence, in order to have operational and accounting convenience, the card limit is to be bifurcated into separate sub-limits for short-term cash credit limit cum savings account and term loans.The drawing limitfor short-term cash credit should be fixed based on the cropping pattern and the amounts for crop production, repairs and maintenance of farm assets and consumption may be allowed to be drawn at the convenience of the farmer. In case the revision of the scale of finance for any year by the district-level committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five-year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed and the farmer is advised about the same. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. For term loans, instalments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of the investment and the repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments. It is to be ensured that at any point in time, the total liability should be within the drawing limit of the concerned year.Wherever the card limit/liability so arrived warrants additional security, the banks may take suitable collateral as per their policy.",

    "details": "The scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” was launched by the Department of Agriculture, Government of Himachal Pradesh by merging three ongoing protection based Departmental schemes namely Sour Badhbandi, Anti-Hail Net Structure & Green House Renovation Scheme into a single scheme having a common objective.The three components of the scheme are as under:1.\tSour Badhbandi (Solar Fencing):Monkey and wildlife menace causes huge losses to crops annually in the State. The present practice of crop protection by manual guarding did not ensure 100 percent crop protection. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” in the name of Solar Fencing. Under this scheme, a subsidy of 85% is being provided if three or more farmers opt to install solar fencing, and if farmers opt to install solar fencing on individual land then an 80% subsidy is being provided. The fence is energized with the help of solar power. Current fences around the farms will be sufficient to keep away stray animals, wild animals, and monkeys from the farms.2.\tAnti-Hail Net Structure:Hailstorms in Himachal Pradesh are one of the major natural calamities resulting in substantial economic loss to the farmers by damaging standing vegetable crops both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. In order to mitigate the losses caused by hail storms the new scheme “Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana (Anti-Hail Net Structure)” was started by the State Government in 2020-21 and implemented through the Department of Agriculture. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojna” in the name of Anti Hail Nets. The schemes will primarily benefit farmers helping them to substantially, reduce the quantitative and qualitative losses to their vegetable produce. Financial assistance maximum of up to 80% is being provided to the eligible farmer for an area coverage maximum of up to 5000 sqm. The monetary gains are expected to be approximately 15-20 crores annually with significant contributions to the state GDP.3.\tGreen House Renovation Scheme:Farmers of the state have demanded that there should be a scheme to replace the Poly sheets. Therefore, the Government of Himachal Pradesh introduced a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Green House Renovation Scheme” in the year 2017-18. Now the scheme has been merged under the Scheme “Mukhyamantri Krishi Utpadan Sanrakshan Yojana” as a component namely Green House Renovation. Under this scheme, 70% assistance is being provided to the farmers for the replacement of poly sheets after 5 years of setting up of polyhouse or damage due to natural calamities.",

    "details": "Agriculture occupies the primary position in the economy of the state of Assam. Over 70% of the state’s population relies on agriculture as farmers, as agricultural labourers, or both for their livelihood. Although agriculture in Assam is characterized by stagnation, low productivity and frequent occurrence of floods, and low levels of public and private investment. The small and fragmented land holdings and frequent floods in the state are a causative factor for farmers to have lower income and agricultural activities become non-remunerative in the State. To boost agricultural productivity, it is pertinent to make interventions through financial assistance to poor farmers. Hence, the finance minister of Assam had announced to assist the farmers to promote the use of scientific farm implements. To encourage the farmer to procure and use such implements, the Department of Agriculture proposed a scheme “Mukhya Mantri Sa Sajuli Yojana” (Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme) for the purpose and launched in FY 2018-19.The scheme “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” is a State Owned Priority Development (SOPD) scheme and the main purpose of launching this scheme for farmers is their holistic development by implementing several farm mechanization schemes. With the help of “Mukhya Mantri Krishi Sa Sajuli Yojana” the government aims to increase farm productivity in the limited land to meet the expanding demand for farm produce and ensure higher income for farmers. As of now, the usage of scientific tools in cultivation is very limited in the state of Assam. So, the state govt. of Assam is making every possible effort through Chief Minister Farm Tool Scheme to ensure the economic growth of rural farmers. Under this scheme, the following is proposed:1.\t₹ 5000/- will be provided to each farmer2.\tThe number of beneficiaries will be a total of 5 lakh farmers.3.\tThe assistance is to procure farm tools/farm implements.4.\tScheme will be implemented on Direct Benefit Transfer by electronic transfer into the accounts of the beneficiaries.5.\tThe Selection of beneficiaries will be done by the District Level Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner of the District.

Also, the cost must not exceed ₹75,000.﻿Construction of Common FacilityThis government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within ₹2 lakh.  Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.﻿Assurance of Clean Drinking WaterThis scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses.

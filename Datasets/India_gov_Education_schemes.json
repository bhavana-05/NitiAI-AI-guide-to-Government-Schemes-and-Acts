    "details": "The scheme “Financial Aid for Providing Hostel Facility to Transgender Students” was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Transgender share the same hopes and dreams as any other individual in our society. 58% of Transgender students drop out before completing 10th grade (24% of Transgender students drop out even before completion of 9th grade). Reasons for this include- severe harassment making studies impossible and other gender-related negative experiences at school. In order to help such school dropouts continue their education, Social Justice Department has implemented a scholarship scheme for Transgender.The transgender community is still ostracized in society and cannot take up job offers or continue their education due to a lack of accommodation facilities. Though there has been improvement in the mindset of the people, still the stigma of giving transgender persons a house exists in society. Due to this problematic scenario, transgender who are pursuing the scholarship scheme are forced to discontinue their studies. For addressing this issue, the Department of Social Justice has introduced this scheme that provides an amount of ₹4,000/- per month as financial assistance to the Transgender community as rent for finding hostel facilities/accommodation.",

    "details": "The National Scheme of Incentive to Girls for Secondary Education promotes the girl child's enrolment of 14-18 years age group at secondary stage, who passes class 8th and subsequently drops out for various socio-economic reasons. The proposed scheme is further intended to retain such girl children up to class 12th. In the year 2004-05, the dropout rate of girls from classes 1st to 8th was about 50.8%. For classes 1st to 10th the dropout rate of girls was about 64% in the same year. Hence, only 36% of the country's girl students could be retained up to class 10th. This is the combined result of several socio-economic factors, but a major contributor is no doubt the inability of the parents to afford the cost of education of the girl child.",

The number of such grants was meager and did not serve the intended purpose. Further, the method of selection of candidates and that of disbursements is cumbersome and time-consuming. In order to do away with these predicaments inherent in the scheme and to provide quality assistance to Schedule Caste (SC) students of Classes V to VIII in a smooth, transparent, and efficient way, a new scheme of providing assistance to the target group is being formulated in the name of \"Shikshashree Scheme\".The \"Shikshashree Scheme\" scheme of providing assistance to SC day scholars of Class V-VIII is evolved by merging the existing schemes of Book Grants and Maintenance Grants.

The mission has initiated this scheme that aims at bringing these children to the mainstream of society.The statistics reveal that in Kerala, around 75,000 children below 18 years are living in orphanages. Around 1500 orphanages are functioning in Kerala. Almost 80- 90% of the children in orphanages have families and relatives. Many orphans and vulnerable children slip further into poverty once the family’s main breadwinner stops working or dies. There is nothing more traumatic for a child than to see a parent die. Added to this tragedy is the loss of adult guidance and protection. Children without proper adult care are more likely to be abused & exploited.Children in this category include orphans, abandoned children, children who have lost their parents in war, communal riots, natural disasters, accidents, etc. They are not properly fed; they have no shelter, nutritious food, health care, education, or any recreation. Most of them are facing economic and social exploitation. They are deprived of the love and affection of the family and are often unwanted by family members.Objectives of the Scheme:To identify the orphaned children in the community.To assess and prioritize children in the greatest need.To provide social protection to highly vulnerable groups of orphans by strengthening traditional family and community systems for protecting and absorbing orphans.To improve the basic education, social integration, and nutrition of the most vulnerable groups of orphans towards the levels of other children in the community.To encourage families to live their children within the family setup rather than sending them to orphanages.To extend a helping hand to these orphan families by way of providing financial assistance for the education of children.",

    "details": "The Scheme “Tagore National Scholarship for Cultural Research” has been introduced to invigorate and revitalize the various institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC) and other identified cultural institutions in the country, by encouraging scholars/academicians to affiliate themselves with these institutions to work on projects of mutual interest.With a view to infusing fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these scholars/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in theGuidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Scholars to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications. The nodal institutions (both MoC and non-MoC) are classified into four groups broadly based on their different areas of specialization, focus, and resources. The classification is as follows:1.\tGroup-A: Archaeology, Antiquities, Museums & Galleries2.\tGroup-B: Archives, Libraries and General Scholarship3.\tGroup-C: Anthropology & Sociology4.\tGroup D: Crafts, Performing/Visual/Literary ArtsScope of the Scheme:The scope of the Scheme is to enable the identified cultural institutions to engage Scholars of outstanding merit, to work on research projects in order to unravel their unexplored resources. For purposes of convenience, monitoring, accounting, and responsibility, one of the institutions listed above would be the ‘Nodal Institution’ for each project, and the Scholars will be attached/anchored to that institution.Duration of the Scholarship:The duration of the Tagore Scholarship is up to 2 years.In exceptional cases, the institution may recommend to the NSC an extension for a period of up to one more year, or a reduction to somewhat less than two years, if it is supported by its assessment of the quality of the work undertaken. However, in the case of extension, the Scholar won’t be eligible for any remuneration including contingency.The award of the Scholarship will commence from the date of joining and the ‘months’ and ‘years’ will be reckoned accordingly.Number of Scholarships:The scheme envisages the granting of up to 25 Scholarships in a year.Each nodal institution can be awarded 1 Scholarship or a maximum of 2 scholarships in a year. However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.Administration of the Scheme:The total number of Scholarships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Scholars to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Scholars, through outsourcing or Consultants.",

However, with respect to Scholars from University, College, Research Institute or Government set up, HRA will be paid by the Parent Organization as per entitlement.MoC Institutions will bear the expenditure in this regard from the grant-in-aid received by them from their administrative Division of the Ministry.In respect of Non-MoC Institutions, the Ministry of Culture will reimburse the House Rent Allowance directly to Scholars on submission of rent receipts (in original) to the Participating Institutions who will verify and forward the same to the Ministry for reimbursement.Settling Allowance:A Scholar from outstation will be given, if required, a lump sum grant of ₹1.00 lakh as settling allowance for packing/transportation, etc., of his personal belongings from the old station to the new station of his stay during the tenure of the Scholarship, if he moves station or otherwise transports books and academic effects.Allowance of an equal amount will also be given at the conclusion of the Scholarship for moving out of station.

This may include the provision of a computer with peripherals and connectivity, working space in the institution’s premises, providing a congenial atmosphere to carry out research, etc. Other facilities, like appropriate seating arrangements, library facilities, etc., will also be made available.One important advantage of this scheme will be the access of the Scholars to national institutions for study and avail original and rare research material. In respect of foreign Scholars engaged under this scheme, necessary political/security clearances from the concerned Ministries/Departments shall be obtained by the Ministry of Culture.Encouragement and financial support may also be given to enable the Scholars to present papers at conferences hosted by the concerned institution or other related organizations and institutions, which will be met out/reimbursed, on an ‘actuals’ basis, with a ceiling of ₹1.00 lakh per annum, provided adequate academic interaction is arranged.",
    "eligibility": "A scholar with good academic credentials at least one publication, either a book or a research paper in reputed journals, and 2 years of research/teaching experience will be eligible to apply for the Tagore National Scholarships.This scheme also gives opportunities to young artists/performers to apply for the scholarship.The scholars also need to identify a nodal institution from the list given inAppendix Baccording to their preferences/expertise to conduct original research preferably by using the sources of the same institution. The research work may also include the identification and cataloging of sources available with the institution or the archiving and creation of new sources that the institution should have. (Guidelines for preparing research proposal are given inAppendix A)Areas of Research and Eligible Projects:The selected Scholars will normally work on a project that benefits the Nodal Institution in terms of unraveling its resources. The subject of research should be one that can be usefully pursued with the resources and facilities of the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship, though he/she will be free to draw on the resources and facilities of other institutions, as well.If the subject of research extends to more than one institution or the Scholar otherwise needs to draw upon the resources and facilities of other institution(s), the Nodal Institution awarding the Scholarship would recommend the Scholars to such other institution(s). In rare cases, where two institutions appear to be of almost equal importance to the Scholars, the second institution may be deemed to be the ‘Co-institution’ and the two may sign a Tripartite MoU regarding Intellectual Property, Publication, Credit sharing, facilities, etc. but accounting shall be with the Nodal Institution.Since the Scheme is focused on unraveling the cultural resources of the Nodal Institution, the project must be driven in that direction, that is, to use substantially the resources of the Nodal Institution. The inputs required for the project should have a very strong linkage with the resources available with the Nodal Institution and (in rare cases) the Co-institution.At the end of it, the project outcome must be beneficial for the Nodal Institution or co-institution, if any, and must add to the existing knowledge of the institution/subject.",

It is mandatory to obtain crop insurance for short-term agricultural loans sanctioned for crops notified under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. The cooperative bank itself will arrange for the insurance of such agricultural loans.If a farmer does not receive a loan in a particular year but requires it in the following year, the department will consider his previously submitted application for processing in the next year.Process of Becoming a Member of the Cooperative Society:Interested applicants can apply for membership by filling out the prescribed membership application form available at the concerned society’s office and by depositing ₹108/- as the membership fee.The Board of Directors reviews the membership application through the relevant committee and either accepts or rejects it.

The scheme is also expected to promote inclusive growth and social development in the state.﻿The Telangana government has allocated Rs. 1,000 crores for the implementation of the scheme in the first year. The scheme is expected to be implemented in a phased manner, with eligible families being identified and selected based on a set of criteria such as income level, educational qualification, and entrepreneurial skills.﻿Overall, the Dalit Bandhu Scheme is a path-breaking initiative that aims to uplift the socio-economic status of the SC community in Telangana.

    "details": "TheChief Minister's Krishi Rinn Yojana (CMKRY)is a scheme initiated by the Government of Arunachal Pradesh to support farmers by providing them with zero-interest crop loans. Under this scheme, the government offers an interest subvention of 4% on crop loans or Kisan Credit Card limits up to Rs. 3.00 lakhs, sanctioned by all banks during the current financial year. This interest subvention is provided over and above the subvention given by the Government of India to banks and farmers per the policy circular issued by RBI/NABARD. Additionally, farmers who promptly repay their short-term production credit (crop loan) within one year of disbursement or withdrawal can avail themselves of an interest relief of 3% per annum. In other words, farmers who take loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakhs and make timely repayments are eligible for the zero-interest credit facility. NABARD acts as the channel partner for reimbursement to banks regarding the interest subvention amount of this scheme.

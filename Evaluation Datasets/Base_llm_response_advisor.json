However, if the survival rate is lower than expected, the project may be considered a failure or a partial success.\n\nIn your case, out of 120 trees planted, 30 died due to flood, which means the survival rate is:\n\n(120 - 30) / 120 = 0.75 or 75%\n\nIf the project's expected survival rate was 80% or higher, and the actual survival rate is 75%, it's",

{
  "My SHG has been approved for a Silk Tree Plantation cluster grant, but one member’s plot lacks clear khatauni (revenue entry). Can I include that plot in the cluster PIS to get the ₹17,244 grant?": "Do not include contested land. The Project Implementation Sheet (PIS) requires land ownership/photographs and will be field-inspected; unreliable title risks rejection and recovery. Instead, replace with members having clear land records, obtain the correct khatauni before PIS submission, or offer the plot for a collective rearing centre only after formalised title—follow the cluster selection and inspection process.",
  "I built the foundation using my ₹10,000 and seek the ₹90,000 subsidy instalment. The cluster in-charge delays verification — what can I do?": "The subsidy releases are tied to field inspection and PIS progress reports. Keep receipts/photos of the foundation, written communication to the chowki/cluster in-charge, and request the official field inspection report; escalate to the departmental range/center in-charge if delays persist. Retain bank details for DBT and insist on written reasons if payment is withheld.",
  "My pond construction cost exceeds my 50% share and the cooperative bank is slow. Can I start works and claim later?": "You may use own funds but the district officer approves proposals after survey and will disburse DBT on completion certificate. If taking a loan, ensure the bank approves the department’s proposal so subsidy is routed correctly. Keep the survey proposal, approved estimate, bills and completion certificate — bank-verified loans are accepted for the beneficiary share.",
  "One supplier offered cheaper feed if I submit his dealer bill. Is it okay to submit that bill to claim the 50% subsidy?": "No. The scheme requires original bills for feed/medicines and field verification before DBT. Submitting false invoices risks rejection and recovery. Buy genuine inputs, obtain legitimate bills, and ensure fisheries inspectors verify purchases; that documentation is required for subsidy disbursement.",
  "Our women’s group registered for Mahila Nursery but the Divisional Forest Rights Office asks for khatauni of nursery site; the seller refuses to share. How should we proceed before contract?": "Registration needs Khatauni or a valid land-availability certificate. Don’t sign procurement contracts until the group obtains a registered Khatauni or a formal land availability certificate approved by the Divisional Forest Rights Office. Keep the group proposal, bank passbook and registration certificate ready; department purchases saplings only after proper registration and agreement.",
  "We planted 120 trees and the Range Officer created an FDR. After two years 30 trees died due to flood. Will we still get funds?": "The scheme issues an FDR per plant and a joint inspection after three years to assess surviving plants; payment is proportional to surviving trees. Document the loss with village head/Sarpanch and Range Officer, cooperate in the joint inspection, and submit any repair/proof requested; final disbursement follows inspection results.",
  "I’m a single beneficiary wanting 8 ponds (one-acre each). Can I claim individual maximums under the hilly area scheme?": "The scheme allows an individual to construct up to 10 ponds but grant limits apply per pond and overall caps exist (individual grant up to 500 m³ ponds capped at ₹2.5 lakh per beneficiary); group proposals have separate maxima. Submit land records, Aadhaar and the district proposal; ensure water source availability and district approval before construction.",
  "I’m a woman cooperative member (SC) buying two cows. Is taking a bank loan mandatory for the subsidy?": "Yes — for dairy subsidy, a loan through the District Cooperative Bank is mandatory to receive the grant; the scheme prescribes a grant/loan split (75% grant/25% loan for SC/ST/women). Join the society, obtain membership receipt, get the society to certify/purchase animals from listed farms and submit loan documentation to the bank for sanction.",
  "My harvested paddy burned in the notified mandi area. How and how fast must I claim compensation?": "File the prescribed claim at the Mandi Samiti office within 7 days of the incident; the samiti’s inquiry must finish within one week and payment processes within two months (extensions possible). Provide prescribed documents, cooperate with the inquiry and retain the bank draft/receipt as the samiti disburses sanctioned compensation.",
  "A contractor suggests planting fast-growing eucalyptus to maximise returns and claims incentives will still be paid. Is that allowed?": "No. KAPY explicitly excludes eucalyptus, acacia, silver oak (and several other species) from incentive payments. Use approved species, register before the rainy season, keep Pahani and bank details ready, and claim the year-wise survivor incentives only for eligible species.",
  "I qualified CSIR-NET and my university says they haven’t uploaded/verified my documents so CSIR won’t start DBT. What should I do to get the fellowship started?": "Ask the university’s Student-Welfare/Nodal Officer for the exact missing documents and an upload confirmation. CSIR fellowship requires the university to verify and forward documents; keep copies of your award letter, admission proof, Aadhaar and bank details. Escalate in writing to the Registrar and retain acknowledgement; if delay continues, request the university to share the online submission receipt so CSIR can process DBT.",
  "I’m a Saksham (AICTE) scholar and I’ve been offered a small stipend by my Department. Can I keep both?": "No — Saksham requires the beneficiary not to receive other financial assistance during the course. If you take another stipend you must disclose it; receipt of other aid can lead to discontinuation and recovery of Saksham funds. Best practice: seek written permission from the institute/AICTE before accepting additional stipends or decline the additional aid to retain Saksham.",
  "Our college runs three active student clubs. Can we submit three SPICES proposals (one per club) this year?": "No — SPICES allows only one proposal per institute. The institute must choose its best performing club (minimum 50 members) and commit the required institutional contribution. Submit a single, well-documented proposal with coordinator credentials and the club’s action plan to avoid ineligibility.",
  "We applied for eSS but our campus doesn’t have a static IP or 32 Mbps; can we still be considered for subscription renewal?": "eSS eligibility requires specified digital infrastructure (e.g., ≥32 Mbps bandwidth and static IPs). Renewal also needs proof of e-resource usage (Jan–Sep) and feedback. If you lack infra, document constraints and seek institutional IT upgrade before renewal; temporary workarounds aren’t guaranteed—obtain principal’s undertaking and plan for required connectivity to meet renewal criteria.",
  "I got conditional selection for MITACS (AICTE GRI). My passport/visa were delayed. Will AICTE still support my $3,000 CAD share?": "AICTE contribution is conditional on the student applying to MITACS and completing pre-departure formalities (passport/visa). Students must apply via the MITACS portal and secure travel documents before departure. Inform MITACS/AICTE about delays and keep documentary proof; AICTE’s support follows MITACS acceptance and compliance with its guidelines.",
  "I’m a full-time faculty with an admission offer from a top-500 foreign university under QIP-FU. What funding/support can I expect and how to apply?": "QIP-FU offers a scholarship (e.g., ₹25,000/month) for eligible full-time faculty admitted to PhD programs at listed top-500 foreign universities. Apply offline to AICTE with admission documents, passport/visa and institute recommendation; follow the scheme’s submission steps and include required attestations for release of grant.",
  "My parent is a registered construction worker but registration renewal is pending; my Medhavi incentive is on hold. What can the student do?": "Medhavi requires the guardian’s labour registration certificate, Aadhaar and marksheet. If renewal is pending, obtain a receipt of renewal application from the labour office and submit it with other documents to the labour department/CSC; beneficiaries become eligible 90 days after registration. Keep copies and follow up with the labour office for verification to expedite benefits.",
  "I accidentally submitted two tablet applications (one from school, one direct). What happens?": "The scheme allows only one application per applicant; multiple submissions are rejected. Contact the Digital Gujarat helpdesk and your school/principal immediately with application IDs and ask which submission will be retained; keep Aadhaar, 12th marksheet and bank details ready to resolve duplication.",
  "I applied for Gujarat Foreign Study Loan ₹10 lakh. Do I need property security and when does repayment start?": "Loan terms vary by amount: for loans up to ₹7.5 lakh property may be required (or weaker security rules apply); documents include Class-12 marksheet, income cert and property docs for higher loans. Repayment schedules differ (e.g., loans ≤₹5 lakh repay over 5 years; >₹5 lakh over 6 years) with a one-year post-study grace period — check sanction letter for exact collateral and schedule.",
  "I qualified for Super-30 Tripura but my family income certificate is older than three years. Will I be disqualified?": "SUPER-30 requires an original income certificate (SDM/DCM) as part of documents. If the certificate is older than permitted, get a fresh income certificate from the competent authority before final submission. Maintain your selection test admit card, Class-X marksheet and PRTC; follow the online registration and upload current documents to confirm eligibility.",
  "I’m a small farmer — how do I get an interest-free loan under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and what documents are mandatory?": "You must be a cooperative society member (or become a nominal member for direct bank loans). Loans: up to ₹1 lakh (agri), ₹3 lakh (non-agri), ₹5 lakh (SHGs). Provide cooperative membership proof, Aadhaar, bank passbook, project/work plan, income/asset details and two guarantors. One beneficiary per family; ensure you are not a defaulter. Apply via your cooperative or district nodal office.",
  "Our tea garden wants the 3% interest subvention on working capital — what disqualifies us and how do we claim?": "Subvention applies to standard working-capital loans (not NPAs) and is reimbursed via DBT (max claim rules apply). Ensure your bank classifies the loan as standard, maintain loan documents and interest certificates, and file claims on the ATISIS portal within prescribed windows. Bank verification and departmental checks are mandatory before reimbursement.",
  "We bought new processing machinery — can we claim plant & machinery subsidy and what proof is essential?": "Eligible units may claim a 25% subsidy on new plant & machinery (caps such as up to ₹30 lakh apply). Submit original invoices, installation/commissioning certificates, proof of commercial production start and Tea Board/registration documents within the scheme’s claim period (usually 12 months). Machinery must be new and retained as per scheme conditions.",
  "My family is eligible for AASRA— how long will the UT pay PMSBY/PMJJBY premiums and what docs are needed?": "The UT pays PMSBY/PMJJBY premiums for five years for eligible beneficiaries. Enrol via JK e-services with Aadhaar, residence proof, bank details and income/BPL/widow documentation. Keep nominee details updated; claims follow insurer rules and departmental verification in case of payout events.",
  "I’m an ST student admitted abroad with a bank loan — how do I claim the 6% interest subsidy?": "The scheme gives 6% p.a. subsidy (subject to caps, e.g., up to ₹25 lakh loans; max subsidy limits apply). Submit offline application to the Tribal Development office with Aadhaar, caste certificate, admission/fee receipts and the bank loan sanction letter. Processing involves verification by the tribal office and the bank before subsidy release.",
  "I have a first home loan of ₹7 lakh — how much subsidy can I get and what are disqualifications?": "First-time borrowers in Assam with loans ≥₹5 lakh may get graduated subsidies (examples up to ₹1–2.5 lakh depending on loan size). Family income must be ≤ ₹20 lakh and the loan account must not be an NPA. Apply online via the state portal with loan sanction, property papers and identity documents; confirm precise slab applicable to your loan.",
  "We bought benchmarked machinery — what steps ensure ATUFS CIS is sanctioned?": "Buy new, notified machinery with a Machine Identification Code (MIC). Upload purchase invoices, proof of payment, company/enterprise registration and commissioning certificate on the iTUFS portal. JIT inspection verifies MIC and installation; only then CIS (credit-linked subsidy) is sanctioned. Second-hand machines are ineligible.",
  "My state didn’t join CPIS — can I still insure palms and what is my premium share?”": "If the state doesn’t co-fund, planters can still join but farmer contribution rises (board covers 50%; state 25%; farmer 25% is standard; minimum farmer share may rise if state opts out). Select appropriate age-band coverage, submit plantation details and pay your share of premium; check insurer/state instructions for enrolment periods and rebates on multi-year policies.",
  "I’m an SC beneficiary approved for Dalit Bandhu — what paperwork and post-approval obligations exist?": "Submit caste certificate, Aadhaar, bank details and a feasible business plan to the Telangana Dalit Bandhu Corporation. The Corporation conducts feasibility, issues phased disbursements, and provides training. Maintain project accounts, utilization certificates and attend capacity-building sessions to avoid fund stoppage or recovery.",
  "I got an Arivu loan ₹2 lakh for professional study; what are renewal conditions and when must I start repayment?": "Arivu loans run ₹50k–₹5 lakh per year. Renewal may require an interim payment (scheme notes show e.g., 12% of previous year’s loan as renewal condition). Repayment typically starts six months after course completion; a service/processing charge (e.g., 2%) may apply. Apply/renew via the KMDC portal with Aadhaar, admission offer and income proof.",
  "I signed a contract farming agreement in 2021 with a private buyer; after the Farm Laws Repeal Act, 2021, can the buyer unilaterally alter price/payment terms?": "The Repeal Act annulled the 2020 farm laws but does not itself validate or void private contracts entered lawfully. Enforceability depends on the contract terms and general contract law. Preserve the written agreement, check for express variation/termination clauses, and if buyer tries unilateral change, issue a written notice reserving rights and seek enforcement/relief in civil court or arbitration per the contract. Consider mediation first to avoid disruption.",
  "A local APMC refuses to allow an outside buyer who claims the farm laws allowed inter-market sales. What should I advise the buyer?": "The repeal restored pre-2020 legal positions for market regulation unless state rules differ. Advise the buyer to check local APMC rules and state notifications; if the state has specific orders permitting outside trade, rely on those. Otherwise the buyer must transact within authorised market yards/venues. Consider non-market direct purchase arrangements only if they comply with existing state APMC and municipal rules.",
  "A village group wants technical training from the University — can they demand it and what formal route exists?": "The Act mandates extension education and outreach. Advise the group to approach the University’s extension/ Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or Directorate of Extension with a written request. Keep records of correspondence; if denied without reason, escalate to the University’s Extension Cell or Vice-Chancellor. The Act empowers the University to run training; it’s a legitimate administrative request route.",
  "I was promised a certificate by the university for a training program but they delayed — can I force issuance?": "The University may grant certificates per the Act and its Statutes. Start with a written reminder to the relevant department. If unreasonable delay persists, file a grievance under the University’s statutory grievance redressal mechanism and preserve proof of completion. Administrative remedies must be exhausted before litigation; statutory functions of the University give it duty to issue certificates when criteria are met.",
  "My village has been declared a “controlled area” for anthrax — can authorities seize my vaccinated cattle?": "Controlled area declarations allow movement restrictions and quarantine measures, not arbitrary seizure of healthy vaccinated animals. Authorities may impose quarantine, inspect, or detain infected animals. Keep vaccination certificates and compliance records. If officials seek to seize animals, demand written orders citing statutory provisions; consult a local veterinarian and file an immediate representation to the Director or Competent Officer. Legal challenge is possible if action exceeds statutory powers.",
  "A Competent Officer ordered mass vaccination but didn’t give notice — is the order valid?": "The Act contemplates compulsory vaccination for scheduled diseases. While emergency disease control can justify immediate measures, procedural fairness remains important. Ask the officer for statutory basis and written order. If notice requirement exists for that provision, point it out and request post-facto confirmation; if rights violated, administrative review or writ petition may be available. Document all interactions and compliance steps.",
  "A seed seller’s packet lacks labelling and my crop failed — what immediate legal steps should a farmer take?": "The Seeds Act requires proper labelling/marks and minimum germination/purity for notified varieties. Preserve the packet, invoice and failed-sample; lodge a written complaint with the State Seed Inspector and request sample testing at the State or Central Seed Laboratory. Consider seeking compensation under the Act after test results; the Act provides for forfeiture and penalties for contraventions.",
  "I’m a small farmer who saved seeds from a protected variety and sold them locally—does the Seeds Act restrict that?": "The Seeds Act regulates sale of notified kinds/varieties; exemptions exist for direct farm-to-farm sales from farmer’s own premises. Keep records proving farm-origin and direct sale. However, branded seed sale and large-scale commercial sale of notified varieties requires compliance. For ambiguity, seek certification or written advice from State Seed Certification agency.",
  "A seed company claims plant variety rights over a local landrace my family conserved—how can I protect community rights?": "The Act recognises farmers’ varieties and provides for community claims and benefit-sharing. Collect documentary and oral evidence of local use/maintenance, file a claim with the Authority or notify the Registrar about prior use. The Authority can determine benefit sharing; the Act also protects conservation contributions and allows community representation for claims. Obtain legal help to prepare evidence for the Authority.",
  "A breeder sold propagating material that failed to perform—can farmers get compensation?": "Yes—the Act allows farmers or groups to seek compensation before the Authority if sold propagating material of a registered variety fails to deliver expected performance. File a complaint with details, allow the Authority to hear parties, and the Authority may direct compensation if it finds the breeder liable. Keep sale records and performance evidence.",
  "I run a shrimp farm inside CRZ since 2002; Authority issued demolition for lack of registration — what immediate steps?": "Preserve proof of continuous operation/ownership and apply immediately for registration; the Act provides transitional protections for pre-appointed day units and retrospective validation where registration was earlier granted. Seek an interim stay from the Appellate Authority under the Act, present old licences/utility bills/measurement-records, and invoke section(s) validating historic registrations. Exhaust administrative appeals first; prepare judicial relief only if administrative remedies fail.",
  "The Authority issues biosecurity orders that require pond upgrades I can't afford — is there relief?": "The Act empowers biosecurity standards; however, administrative discretion should consider hardship. File a representation seeking phased compliance, technical assistance, or subsidy references; seek interim extension while applying for financial support programs. Document communications. If arbitrary, administrative review or appeal to the Appellate Authority is available.",
  "My consignment was stopped under a notification alleging it carried a pest—can I challenge seizure?": "Notifications under the Act empower inspection, detention, fumigation and destruction. Demand a written grounds/order, request sample testing, and preserve evidence. Administrative remedies include representation and review by the authorised officers; where seizure is unlawful, seek judicial review after exhausting statutory appeal routes. Keep records of losses for compensation claims if wrongful seizure proven.",
  "A state rule fines me for transporting plant material — is the fine enforceable?": "State rules under the Act may prescribe fines for contraventions. Verify the notification’s validity, ensure procedural requirements were followed, and seek statutory appeal if fined incorrectly. Pay fines under protest to avoid escalation while pursuing remedies, or apply for stay in appropriate forum if urgent.",
  "I imported cattle biologics but Customs detained them as unnotified—what should I do?": "The Act allows the Central Government to regulate imports of livestock and related products. Ask Customs for the specific notification basis, provide permits, health certificates, and request inspection or fumigation as required. If detained without statutory basis, file an appeal under customs procedure and seek release by complying with import conditions or applying for exemption/clearance from Central authorities.",
  "An importer tells me a Central notification bans semen imports—can I rely on that to cancel purchase orders?": "Yes—if the Central Government has notified a prohibition/restriction, imports become unlawful. Confirm the Gazette notification; contractual cancellations may be justified as force-majeure or illegality. Preserve communications and seek contract remedies; coordinate with supplier for lawful alternatives.",
  "A trader says my produce needs AGMARK and threatens criminal action if I sell—what are my rights?": "The Act allows the Central Government to require compulsory grading for scheduled articles. If a notification requires the grade for your article and area, comply by obtaining authorised marking or selling in authorised channels. If no such notification applies, a threat is unfounded. Request written basis for enforcement and, if necessary, seek clarification from the Directorate of Marketing or challenge overreach. Criminal prosecution requires authorised complaint.",
  "I found counterfeit grade marks on incoming stock—how do I act?": "Counterfeiting a grade mark is an offence under the Act. Preserve evidence, take photographs, and file a written complaint with the authorised Government department or police. Cooperate with investigations; the Act provides for prosecution and penalties for counterfeiting.",
  "My newly-formed cooperative seeks loan support—what powers does the NCDC have to help?": "NCDC funds and supports cooperative programmes for storage, processing and allied activities.

NCDC’s financial assistance is channelled through nationalised banks and state agencies per Act provisions; follow prescribed formats and eligibility criteria.",
  "The cooperative board refused to convene a meeting to remove a corrupt secretary—what recourse?": "The Act and model bye-laws require proper procedure. Call for a meeting per the Society/Cooperative rules, record notices, and involve Registrar of Cooperatives or the Corporation’s advisory channels if internal remedy fails. Administrative intervention may compel compliance; preserve minutes and correspondence for formal complaints.",
  "NDDB introduced new procurement standards that my village union cannot meet—can we seek phased implementation?": "NDDB advises and implements development measures; it generally allows coordination with state cooperative unions. File representation asking for phased timelines, technical assistance and capacity building. NDDB and state joint programmes often include transitional support; document operational constraints and propose a remedial plan. Administrative negotiation is the practical first step.",
  "A private processor claims exclusivity over milk from our cooperative due to an oral arrangement—is that enforceable?": "Oral arrangements can be binding but are harder to enforce. Check NDDB/cooperative bye-laws and any written procurement contracts. Advise documenting claims, issuing notice seeking clarification, and if necessary, renegotiating or seeking injunctive relief for alleged breach. Cooperatives should maintain transparent procurement policies per Act guidance.",
  "A foreign breeder applied for registration of a variety derived from our tribal landrace—how can the community stake a claim?": "The Act allows community claims for contribution to evolution of varieties. Compile evidence (community testimony, traditional records), file claim before the Authority, and request the notified centre to verify contribution. The Authority can order benefit sharing or recognition if the community’s claim is substantiated. Engage counsel to organise evidence and file formally.",
  "My state declared export restrictions after an outbreak—can I be compensated for blocked animal sales?": "Control measures aim to protect animal and human health; compensation is typically discretionary and depends on statutory schemes or relief packages. File a claim with state Director of Animal Husbandry documenting losses and compliance. If state rules provide compensation or relief, follow prescribed claim procedure; otherwise seek administrative review or representation for relief measures.",
  "A State Seed Laboratory report shows off-spec seed; seller disputes it—what administrative appeal exists?": "The Act provides appeal and sampling procedures. Ensure chain of custody, request re-testing or appeal to the appellate authority prescribed in the Act. Preserve all test reports and invoices; if seller refuses remedy, pursue statutory penalties and forfeiture proceedings as per Act.",
  "Our FPO’s project was rejected by NCDC citing inadequate business plan—can we request reconsideration?": "Yes—seek written reasons, revise the business plan addressing deficiencies, and request reconsideration or appeal under NCDC procedural rules. Provide additional documents, credit histories and feasibility studies. Engage local Agricultural University for technical validation to strengthen resubmission.",
  "My business received a tax dispute notice for FY 2017–18. Can I still settle under the Vivad se Vishwas scheme now and what happens if I file a declaration?": "Under the Vivad se Vishwas framework a taxpayer may file a declaration and settle specified direct tax disputes by paying the declared amount and following the scheme's procedure. Filing a valid declaration (and paying prescribed amounts) generally closes proceedings covered by the scheme; ensure your dispute falls within the Act’s eligible categories and follow prescribed timelines and forms. Retain proof of payment and the scheme order to prevent reopening.",
  "If I file a declaration under Vivad se Vishwas but later discover an omitted issue, can I reopen the case?": "The scheme is intended to be final for matters covered once the declaration is accepted and payment made. If the scheme’s conditions were complied with (declaration, payment), reopening is normally restricted; however exceptions may exist for fraud or serious non-disclosure. Check the scheme’s exclusion list and preserve records before relying on finality; consult counsel for filings that may require an application under narrow exceptions.",
  "I paid part settlement under the scheme but litigation continues at tribunal. What immediate steps protect my position?": "If litigation continues despite scheme payment, produce scheme acceptance receipts and application records to the tribunal and apply for stay or record correction. Preserve proof of compliance (declaration, challans) and request an administrative clarification from the tax authority; if incorrect classification occurred, seek speedy administrative remedy and, if required, file a review or appeal citing the scheme acceptance.",
  "I invested in a local deposit scheme which now stopped payouts. What immediate remedy under the Act can I pursue?": "The Act empowers the Competent Authority to investigate and, where found unregulated, provisionally attach assets and order repayment or freeze operations. File a complaint to the Authority with documentation (agreements, receipts). Request an urgent inquiry and seek provisional relief such as attachment and appointment of an administrator. Preserve communication and avoid further deposits.",
  "The scheme operator says the deposits are loans — can that defeat the Act?": "Substance matters over labels. Authorities will examine the scheme’s features (promises of return, pooling of funds, repayment terms). If the scheme has features of a deposit scheme as defined, labelling as loan won’t avoid regulation. Provide contract terms to the Authority and request classification—this affects provisional measures and potential criminal action.",
  "Can the Competent Authority seize my bank accounts that received scheme payouts?": "The Authority has provisional attachment/search powers over assets of persons controlling the scheme, but seizure of unrelated third-party accounts requires legal process and justification. If you are an investor who merely received payouts, seek prompt disclosure and cooperate; if wrongly targeted, you can petition the Authority or courts for release and show your status as an innocent investor.",
  "What are the appeal routes if the Authority issues an adverse order?": "The Act provides internal appeal/representation procedures to the Authority or specified appellate mechanism; failing administrative remedy, approach the appropriate court/tribunal. File the appeal within statutory timeframes and produce documentary proof (investor contracts, receipts). Seek urgent interim relief if enforcement is imminent.",
  "My manufacturing unit’s annual aggregate turnover is ₹18 lakh — must I register under CGST?": "Registration threshold under the central Act is based on aggregate turnover; generally registration is required if aggregate turnover exceeds statutory limits (commonly ₹20 lakh, subject to notifications and special category adjustments). If your turnover is below the threshold and no other conditions (inter-state supply, e-commerce supplier, reverse charge) apply, you may not be required to register. Confirm limits and any state-specific exceptions.",
  "I bought inputs before GST commencement and have VAT credit. How long to claim transitional credit?": "Transitional input tax credits must be claimed within the statutory period (return/credit window) set by the Act — commonly within 90 days after the appointed day for certain carried-forward VAT/entry tax credits, subject to conditions (returns filed, admissibility under new law). Keep invoices and prior returns as evidence for claiming credit.",
  "My goods were sent on approval before the appointed day and returned after. Is GST payable on the returned goods?": "The Act provides transitional rules: goods sent on approval not earlier than six months before the appointed day and returned within six months from appointed day may not attract tax; if returned after the specified period, tax may be payable by the returning person. Check applicable provisos and any extension by Commissioner.",
  "Revenue issued a show-cause for alleged excess ITC. What immediate procedural protections apply?": "Officers follow assessment and recovery procedures under the Act; you are entitled to notice, opportunity of being heard, and prescribed adjudication timelines. Preserve records, respond to the notice with substantiating invoices and reconciliation, and consider professional representation. Remedies include deposit conditions and appeal routes set out in the Act.",
  "A supplier sold me exempted goods but issued taxable invoices. Can I claim ITC?": "Input tax credit is admissible only where goods/services were used for making taxable supplies and where credit is admissible under the Act. If supplies are exempt, corresponding ITC is generally ineligible. Reconcile the supply character, preserve invoices, and seek rectification or adjustment as per GST rules.",
  "My employer set up an NPS account but switched pension funds without my consent. What remedies under PFRDA?": "PFRDA regulations require subscriber consent for fund management changes and provide CRA/POP procedures. Lodge a complaint with the CRA and the Authority, request reversal or rectification and claim any resulting loss. PFRDA enforces subscriber protection and may order remedies or penalties against intermediaries.",
  "A CRA lost transaction records affecting my contribution allocation. How to proceed?": "PFRDA empowers the Authority to supervise CRAs; file a formal complaint with CRA and PFRDA, request audit trail and corrective crediting. PFRDA can investigate, order restitution and require CRA to compensate or correct records; preserve employer pay-slips and bank proofs.",
  "Are PFRDA board members allowed to accept employment in a pension entity immediately after leaving office?": "There are post-employment restrictions: Chairperson and whole-time members require prior Central Government approval to accept employment in regulated pension entities for a specified cooling-off period (commonly two years). Seek statutory waiver if necessary; non-compliance can invite administrative action.",
  "A bank served a 60-day notice claiming my SME account is NPA and threatened asset recovery. What should I do?": "Under Section 13, secured creditors issue demand notices and can take possession after 60 days. Immediately verify classification, obtain bank’s written reasons, attempt one-time settlement or repay to avoid enforcement, and if wrongful, file an application before the DRT/Tribunal under Section 17 to restrain possession and challenge the action. Preserve all repayment/communication records.",
  "I found a past omission in the return of chargeable interest — what is the remedy?": "The Act allows revised returns within statutory limits or assessment procedures; late filing attracts interest for defaults. Where assessment is reopened, time-limits and explanations govern reopening. File corrected returns promptly and be ready to justify calculations and any bad-debt deductions.",
  "Is there still an active charge under the Interest-Tax Act for current years?": "No — the Act’s charge was phased out (the Act’s provisions show cessation for chargeable interest accruing/ arising after 31 March 2000). Confirm by reviewing the Act’s cessations and applicable assessment years in your file."
